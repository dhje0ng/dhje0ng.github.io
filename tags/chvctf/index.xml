      <description>Summary On the 10th, I participated in the Car Hacking Village CTF at the DEFCON hacking conference in Las Vegas as a member of Autocrypt, which consisted of a total of 13 people. We secured a commendable 4th place finish in the competition. Special thanks to @uberwoozle for organizing this event.
We also had a presentation at this year&amp;rsquo;s Car Hacking Village on &amp;ldquo;AUTOMOTIVE USB FUZZING: HOW TO FUZZING USB IN VEHICLES TO DISCOVER THE REAL-WORLD VULNERABILITIES&amp;rdquo;.</description>
