      <description>Overview On the 12th, I participated in the Car Hacking Village CTF at the DEFCON hacking conference in Las Vegas as a member of Autocrypt, which consisted of a total of 7 people. We secured a commendable 5th place finish in the competition. Special thanks to @uberwoozle for organizing this event.&#xA;The competition featured several automotive-related hacking challenges, including car simulators, analysing vehicle firmware, obtaining ECU information, and Bluetooth hacking.</description>
