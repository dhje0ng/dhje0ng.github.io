      <description>Summary I attended the Car Hacking Village CTF at the DEFCON hacking conference in Las Vegas on the 10th.
I participated as a member of Autocrypt with a total of 13 people and we finished in 4th place at the end of the competition.
We would like to thank @uberwoozle for organizing this competition.
