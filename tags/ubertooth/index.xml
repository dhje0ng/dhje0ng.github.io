      <description>Overview I recently tried sniffing bluetooth packets via ubertooth.&#xA;As far as we know, ubertooth has provided sniffing capabilities for Bluetooth low energy (BLE), but in a recent update, firmware was developed to allow sniffing of Bluetooth packets for the Bluetooth Classic (BR/EDR) specification.&#xA;This is included in the release firmware (2020-12-R1), but it is not the default application, so you can build your own firmware and use the and flash it to your ubertooth device.</description>
